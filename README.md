Order of things:

1. Template download link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6CckRnQm86uSWt4Ym1fSGlycTg
2. Create a new team project in TFS - TourPOC for this project.
3. Create a website with two pages. /Home/Index that will be like http://remtsoy.com/tf_templates/traveler/demo_v1_7/flight-search-2.html. Here - focus only on the flight search functionality and nothing else (no user account, no other pages, all content static).
4. When the user searches a flight - he lands on the search results page: http://remtsoy.com/tf_templates/traveler/demo_v1_7/flights-search-results-2.html . currently it's not clear how to implement "round trip" vs. "one way" in this page - so for the time being you can make the user visit this page twice - once for outbound, once for inbound.
